A "Descriptor" is a program that computes molecular descriptors, where the molecule's descriptors need to be encoded separately.

"GA-BP" is used to predict the separation performance of MMM. For both permeability and selectivity are the same program, the parameters may differ slightly.

Recursive feature elimination "Recursive feature elimination" is the screening of features in molecular descriptors.

"SHAP" is the analysis of characteristic variables.

"Target encoding" encodes the MOF type and polymer type.

The data used in the program are derived from published work.
